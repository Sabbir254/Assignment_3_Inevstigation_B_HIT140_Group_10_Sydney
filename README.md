1. Open the python project file in google colab.
2. Upload the datasets in from device folder directly (not from the drive).
3. We write the code for the extended logistic regression analysis in section 9c. We were confused about what type of extended dataset we could use for that part. Therefore, we have written the code, allowing the viewer to select a relevant dataset, upload it during the same process, and execute the code.
